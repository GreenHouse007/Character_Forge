  {
    name: 'Empower Spell',
    category: 'Metamagic',
    source: 'CRB',
    description: 'You can increase the power of your spells, causing them to deal more damage.',
    benefit: 'All variable, numeric effects of an empowered spell are increased by half, including bonuses to those dice rolls. Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected, nor are spells without random variables. An empowered spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell\'s actual level.',
    prerequisites: [],
    special: 'You can apply this feat to any spell that has variable, numeric effects.',

  {
    name: 'Enlarge Spell',
    category: 'Metamagic',
    source: 'CRB',
    description: 'You can increase the range of your spells.',
    benefit: 'You can alter a spell with a range of close, medium, or long to increase its range by 100%. An enlarged spell with a range of close now has a range of 50 ft. + 5 ft./level, while medium-range spells have a range of 200 ft. + 20 ft./level and long-range spells have a range of 800 ft. + 80 ft./level. An enlarged spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell\'s actual level. Spells whose ranges are not defined by distance, as well as spells whose ranges are not close, medium, or long, do not benefit from this feat.',

    name: 'Extend Spell',
    category: 'Metamagic',
    source: 'CRB',
    description: 'You can make your spells last twice as long.',
    benefit: 'An extended spell lasts twice as long as normal. A spell with a duration of concentration, instantaneous, or permanent is not affected by this feat. An extended spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell\'s actual level.',
    prerequisites: [],
    isWizardBonusFeat: true,
  },
  {
    name: 'Heighten Spell',
    category: 'Metamagic',
    source: 'CRB',
    description: 'You can cast a spell as if it were a higher level.',
    benefit: 'A heightened spell has a higher spell level than normal (up to a maximum of 9th level). Unlike other metamagic feats, Heighten Spell actually increases the effective level of the spell that it modifies. All effects dependent on spell level (such as saving throw DCs and ability to penetrate a lesser globe of invulnerability) are calculated according to the heightened level. The heightened spell is as difficult to prepare and cast as a spell of its effective level.',
    prerequisites: [],
    special: 'Unlike other metamagic feats, Heighten Spell does not use a higher-level spell slot, but instead uses a spell slot of the heightened level.',
    isWizardBonusFeat: true,

    name: 'Maximize Spell',
    category: 'Metamagic',
    source: 'CRB',
    description: 'Your spells have the maximum possible effect.',
    benefit: 'All variable, numeric effects of a spell modified by this feat are maximized. Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected, nor are spells without random variables. A maximized spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell\'s actual level. An empowered, maximized spell gains the separate benefits of each feat: the maximum result plus half the normally rolled result.',

    name: 'Quicken Spell',
    category: 'Metamagic',
    source: 'CRB',
    description: 'You can cast spells in a fraction of the normal time.',
    benefit: 'Casting a quickened spell is a swift action. You can perform another action, even casting another spell, in the same round as you cast a quickened spell. A spell whose casting time is more than 1 round or 1 full-round action cannot be quickened. A quickened spell uses up a spell slot four levels higher than the spell\'s actual level. Casting a quickened spell doesn\'t provoke an attack of opportunity.',

    category: 'Metamagic',
    source: 'CRB',

  {
    name: 'Still Spell',
    category: 'Metamagic',
    source: 'CRB',
    description: 'You can cast spells without moving.',

    description: 'You can increase the area of your spells.',
    benefit: 'You can alter a burst, emanation, or spread-shaped spell to increase its area. Any numeric measurements of the spell\'s area increase by 100%. A widened spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell\'s actual level. Spells that do not have an area of one of these four sorts are not affected by this feat.',
